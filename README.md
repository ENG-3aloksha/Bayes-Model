• Bayes Classifier ( sklearn built in)
• Run it on iris built in dataset
• Implement from scratch function “Don’t use built-in function”:
 train_validate_test_split (data, labels, testRatio =0.3, valRatio =0.3)
• Draw decision boundaries (search internet)
• Implement from scratch function “Don’t use built-in function”:
 calculate_accuracy(predicted_y , y)
• Work in a group of two or three students
Iris Dataset (built-in dataset)
• The dataset contains a set of 150 records under five attributes - sepal
 length, sepal width, petal length, petal width and species.
• This data sets consists of 3 different types of irises’ (Setosa, Versicolour, and
 Virginica) petal and sepal length, stored in a 150x4 numpy.ndarray
• The rows being the samples and the columns being: Sepal Length, Sepal Width,
 Petal Length and Petal Width.
